//In Kotlin, packages are always a folder just like in Java...
//Packages are used to organize our code in a fine manner...
package mph
//Below code, is a function with blocks body it means that was surrounded by {curly braces}...
//So, maxNo() is a "Function with Blocks Body" in Kotlin...
fun maxNo(a:Int,b:Int):Int{
    return if(a > b) a else b
}
//Below code, is a function with expression body it means that was surrounded by {curly braces} it was simply declared in one line...
//For example, x+y = z it's an expression in the same way below minNo() function is declared ok...
//Here, minNo() is a "Function with Expression Body" in Kotlin...
//One thing to say if our function is going to return only one expression(value) then use function with expression body it's highly recommended one for that...
//fun minNo(x:Int,y:Int) : Int = if(x < y) x else y
//To be, more "Kotlinish" we can also omit the return type of minNo() function...
//So, we can omit the return type for a function with expression body in Kotlin...
fun minNo(x:Int,y:Int) = if(x < y) x else y
//Here, in Kotlin "Unit" = "Void" ok...
//If our function return nothing means then we can put that return type as Unit...
//Below, code is an example for Unit coz that multiply() function doesn't return any value...
//Unit return type in Kotlin is equal to Void return type in Java ok...
fun multiply(m:Int,n:Int):Unit{
    println(m*n)
}
//Here, in kotlin we don't need to specify type for a function that returns nothing...
fun divide(i:Int,j:Int){
    println(i/j)

//Here, if a function that returns something then we must need to specify its type explicitly otherwise the error will be thrown...
//Below, the function pi() return values in decimal.So, we must need to specify its type explicitly as double...

    //In Kotlin, we can assign a function to a variables it's much possible...

    //Here, for miniNo variable the minNo() function is just assigned...
